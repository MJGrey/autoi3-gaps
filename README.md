# autoi3-gaps

*Note* this is a personal repo, not intended for others, use at your own risk.

Making a repo that holds the dot files and my automation script to create a i3-gaps WM in ubuntu. Special thanks to:

Ben James (https://benjames.io) for the putting the steps together for me to use. 

Luke Smith (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) for doing all the work with the dotfiles and configs.

Dylan Araps (https://github.com/dylanaraps/) for creating pywal (seriously, its a great little script and great fun to play around with).

to run:

git clone https://github.com/MJGrey/autoi3-gaps
./install_i3_dependencies.sh
