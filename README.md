# autoi3-gaps

Making a repo that holds the dot files and my automation script to create a i3-gaps WM in ubuntu. Special thanks to:

Luke Smith (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) for doing all the work with the dotfiles and configs.

Dylan Araps (https://github.com/dylanaraps/) for creating pywal (seriously, its a great little script and great fun to play around with).
